# Project Setup

This project consists of two main parts: the backend and the frontend. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Java JDK
- Maven
- A SQL database

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Run the `init_db.sql` script to initialize the database. This script creates necessary tables and populates them with some initial data.
3. Once the database is set up, you can start the backend server. Make sure the server is running on port 8080. The context path should be `/backend`. This means the API can be accessed at `localhost:8080/backend`.
4. You can access the admin dashboard with:
```
    username : admin
    password : a
```

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Run the frontend server. The port for the frontend server does not matter.

Once both servers are running, you can start using the application. Enjoy!
